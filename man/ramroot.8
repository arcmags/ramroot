.SH NAME
ramroot \- load root file system to zram during boot
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBramroot\fR is a mkinitcpio hook that loads the root filesystem to zram.  In
early boot stages, ramroot checks for available memory, and prompts users with
the option to boot the root filesystem from zram.
.SH CONFIGURATION
\fBramroot\fR configuration is done via \fI/etc/ramroot.conf\fR.  A default configuration
only attempts to load the root \fI/\fR filesystem to zram.  The directories \fI/etc/ramroot.z/\fR and \fI~/ramroot.z/\fR may be used for additional customization.
